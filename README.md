# Next.js 15 Server Component Dynamic Import Issue

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug encountered when utilizing dynamic imports within Next.js 15 server components.  The core problem lies in the server-side rendering (SSR) process failing to correctly resolve the import path of dynamically imported modules.

## Problem Description

When a server component attempts to dynamically import a module using `import()`, the import resolution might fail during SSR. This happens because the server environment might not have access to or correctly resolve the target module's path. This leads to runtime exceptions or unexpected behavior in the client-side rendering phase. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/dynamic-import` in your browser.

You will likely see an error related to the dynamic import failing to resolve during server-side rendering.

## Solution

The solution involves refactoring to avoid the use of dynamic imports within the main server component's rendering logic.  Alternative approaches include:

* **Pre-fetch data on the server:** If the data from dynamic module is needed for SSR, fetch it on the server beforehand and pass it to the main component as props.
* **Using Static Imports:** The simple solution is to use Static imports instead of dynamic imports.

See the `solution` branch for a demonstration of these solutions.

## Further Considerations

This issue highlights the importance of understanding the limitations and nuances of dynamic imports within server components in Next.js 15. Carefully consider how and when to use dynamic imports in your server-side code to avoid unexpected runtime errors and performance issues.
